- en: MySQL, launched in 1995, has become the most popular open source database system.
    The popularity of MySQL and phpMyAdmin has allowed many non-IT specialists to
    build dynamic websites with a MySQL backend. This book is a short but complete
    guide showing beginners how to design good data structures for MySQL. It teaches
    how to plan the data structure and how to implement it physically using MySQL's
    model.
